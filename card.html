						The fastest land animal in the world, a cheetah can reach 112km/h in just three seconds – that’s faster than a sports car accelerates! Its body has evolved for speed, with long legs, an elongated spine, adapted claws to grip the ground and a long tail for balance.

						Cheetahs have a pale yellow coat with black dots on the upper parts, and are white on the underbelly. Their faces are distinguished by prominent, black lines that curve from the inner corner of each eye to the outer corners of the mouth

					<p class="text">
						These fierce felines hunt during the day to avoid competition from other powerful predators such as lions, hyenas and leopards. And boy, can they hunt! First, they use their exceptional eyesight to scan their surroundings before quietly stalking their chosen prey. Then, when the time is right, they sprint from cover, knock down their victim and kill it with a bite to the throat.

					<span class="label">Social Life</span>:
					<p class="text"> 
					cheetahs are usually found in groups, consisting of either a mother and her young, siblings (who stay together for around six months after leaving the mother) or a coalition of males who live and hunt together. Adult females, however, tend to be solitary and only meet with males to mate.

					<p class="text">
						Sadly, this beautiful animal is threatened by loss of habitat and prey, as well as conflict with humans. As a result, the cheetah is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red list, and, today, an estimated 9,000-12,000 remain in Africa.

Name: Cheetah

Latin Name: Acinonyx jubatus

African Names: Dume (Swahili), Nkonkoni (Zulu), Didigwe (Shona), Letlôtse (Tswana)

Height: Cheetahs average height is 35 inches. Cheetahs are 45 inches to 53 inches long and their tail can measure up to 33 inches in length.

Average Adult Weight: Cheetahs weigh anywhere from 88 pounds to 140 pounds.

Life Span: 12 years in the wild and 20 years in captivity.

Description: Cheetahs have a deep chest and narrow waist. Their fur is spotted, even their tail is spotted. They have a white belly and black tear-stained face which helps keep the sun out of their eyes. Some cheetahs have a mutated spot pattern with larger spots that are blotchy and merged. These cheetahs are known as “king cheetahs”.

Habitat: Savannahs, both open and more densely vegetated. They are not found in forest areas or wetlands.

Countries found in: Found primarily in Africa. Cheetahs were at one time found across Asia and most of Africa. The heaviest concentrations of the cheetah population can be found in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Namibia, Angola, and The Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Babies: Gestation period of 90 to 98 days. Female cheetahs can have up to 9 cubs at a time. The average litter size is 3 to 5 cubs. The cheetah hit a genetic bottleneck, due to excessive in breeding, about 10,000 years ago and all modern cheetahs are descended from a core 18 cheetahs making successful reproduction difficult.

Food: Cheetahs hunt mostly mammals under 88 pounds including gazelles, springbok, impala, guinea fowl, and hares. Cheetahs will also hunt younger wildebeests and zebras. Cheetahs are diurnal hunters and hunt by sight rather than by smell.
